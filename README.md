## About
I am a freshman at the University of Southern California where I am pursuing my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in astronautical engineering. I was a member of Project Lead the Way throughout high school where I learned basic physics and engineering concepts and documented group project work. I am looking to further my engineering, documentation, and collaborative skills.


## ‚úàÔ∏è Aerospace Engineering Projects

### Balsa Wood Glider
I worked with one other student to design a Balsa wood glider that consists of a fuselage, wings, and a horizontal and vertical stabilizer. We drew separate designs and compared them during our group discussion, coming to a consensus on our final design. We simulated our glider in Aery32, changing the dimensions of each component until the glider had the ability to fly. Measuring and cutting each part on a strip of Balsa wood, we constructed the glider and performed 6 flight tests. Our glider flew, but we came to the conclusion that the wings could be reshaped and nose mass decreased in order to improve flight performance.

### Airfoil Redesign
I worked with another student to redesign an airfoil for a Zl√≠n Z 42 aircraft. I drew a rough sketch of the original airfoil, having 2,911 pounds of lift and a lift to drag ratio of 11.6. Using the FoilSim simulator, I modified the airfoil‚Äôs angle of attack, thickness, and camber line. We ended up with an angle of attack of -3¬∫, a thickness of 8%, and a camber of 5%. The smaller angle of attack allows the air to flow straighter off the wing which decreases the upward vertical force and therefore decreases lift. Also, decreasing the thickness of the airfoil allows the air to flow more linear off the wing as well. If I were to continue this project, I would conduct more tests in the simulation with smaller intervals between percentages to see if there is a combination that would generate the same amount of lift with a greater L/D ratio.

## üí° Digital Electronics Projects

### Seatbelt Circuit
I worked in a group with three other students to design a circuit for a seatbelt alarm that would take the inputs of three variables: the door, ignition, and seatbelt clip. We created a truth table to demonstrate the alarm turning on when the door is closed, ignition is on, and seatbelt clip is not buckled. I drew a schematic sketch of the circuit and tested the schematic using Multisim, producing the correct output that matched our Boolean expression. We then worked to build the circuit on a myDAQ board using an inverter and AND logic chip. After solving the problem of not powering and grounding our chips, we expected our circuit to function the same as our simulation, triggering the seatbelt alarm when the door is closed, ignition is on, and seatbelt clip is not buckled. We weren‚Äôt given enough time to test the built circuit, but we discussed improvements to add if the project were to be worked again, such as another variable to detect weight in the seat.

### Voting Circuit
I worked with one student to designed a circuit to take four voting inputs and output the results of a theoretical election using a green and red LED. The ‚ÄúPresident‚Äôs‚Äù vote, or P variable, was the dominant vote to decide in case of a tie. I created a truth table for each possible combination of votes and turned it into a Boolean expression. I simplified the expression using Boolean algebra and simulated the working circuit in Multisim. I created a simulation of the wired circuit in Tinkercad and began building on a myDAQ board, documenting each step. The P switch had several wires that needed to be connected, so we powered a column on the myDAQ board to allow for more inputs. Although we couldn‚Äôt test the built circuit due to technical difficulties, we expected it to work successfully like our Tinkercad simulation did, lighting up the red LED for a failing vote and the green LED for a passing vote.

### Date of Birth Circuit
I designed a circuit to display my date of birth on a 7-segment display in the format: MM-DD-YY. I created a truth table which included the three switches to count in binary for each of the 8 symbols needed to be displayed, and each of the outputs on the 7-segment display. I used Karnough mapping to simplify the expressions for each of the 7 light segments, and simulated them in Multisim using AND, OR, and inverter chips. I then converted my circuit to all NAND chips, and then all NOR chips to find which components of the circuit can be simplified and use fewer logic chips and gates. I combined AOI, NAND, and NOR gates to create my final circuit with the expressions for each light segment. I successfully simulated my circuit in Multisim and the build in Tinkercad. I collaborated with another classmate to build my circuit on a myDAQ board. We had to rewire a segment, but the circuit successfully displayed my date of birth on the 7-segment display in the end. If working on this project again, I would color-code the wires for each of my segments so it would be easier to identify wires of a segment that isn‚Äôt working properly.
